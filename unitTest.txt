Unit Testing plan for bomb catcher

*Test device and items to make sure non null if( !d3d_ok) return NULL; or if !SUCCEEDED
---make sure that all pointers are pointing to non null memory locations
---can also be done with asserts

*Header tests to make sure headers actually lead to where they need to go
---Can be automated thru frameworks like Hestia or visualassert or checker functions

*Function tests to make sure all functions run and are used
---Can be automated thru frameworks like Hestia or visualassert or done via a self written test file
      that tests, makes sure return is correct, and parameters link correctly

*Test access. Make sure private members are not accessible outside and that public are


visualassert, as a fully integrated framework with visual studio, is an optimal framework
with the addition of a service like coverall, a fully functional testing suite can be created.
