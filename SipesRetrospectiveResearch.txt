| SAILBOAT RETROSPECTIVE |
--------------------------

Created by: Luke Hohmann, improved upon by Mark Summers (and many others)

PROS:
   -Creative
   -Visual
   -Fully encompassing (problems, successes)

CONS:
   -Theme may pigeonhole team members who have a harder time seeing 
    abstraction or get caught up in the narrative


Description:
A retrospective that uses a sailboat visual to ask what wind propels the sails,
what anchors are holding the ship back, what pirates/rocks/dangers could be
lurking, and a visualisation of the "promised land" (what the end product should
be).



Process:
1. Setup:
   Large picture of a sailboat is drawn with sail full, anchors behind, 
   rocks/pirates/other things in front, and promised land further off. 
   Sticky notes are handed out to members of team.
2. Data Gathering:
   Members are instructed to write down what has gone well/should be 
   continued to help propel the ship, what is currently holding us
   back, and what dangers they see in the current state of things.
   Members are instructed to write one item down per sticky note and
   place them on the diagram in their designated spots.
3. Synthesising:
   A pattern will begin to form, like items can be placed together and
   discussion should begin.
4. Next:
   Members can vote on what they think from each categories are most 
   important to address and continue discussion and resolutions
   internally.


Why I think it is a good idea:
Personally, I like when there's a visual aspect to group activities.
It's a fully formed narrative that also plays well to what we're 
doing and really what we need to be looking at. I like the idea
that it focuses on both the positive and negatives, creating a 
fully formed look at what has been done and what needs to be done.

| APPRECIATIVE RETROSPECTIVE |
------------------------------

Created by: Hibri Marzook

PROS:
   -focuses on positives
   -refocuses positively towards the future

CONS:
   -Focusing purely on the positive neglects the issues, particularly when 
    there are major issues in previous sprints that need to be refocused.


Description:
A retrospective that focuses on the positive aspects focusing on what went
well so far under the prime idea that everyone on the team is doing/did the best job
they can/could.



Process:
1. Setup:
   Ask each team member to write a note of appreciation to another team member.
   Read them out loud.
2. Data Gathering:
   Using three colours of post it notes, have each team member write about
   successes, events, and strengths of the previous sprint; seperate them on the 
   board.
3. Synthesising:
   Hand out a second set of three colours. Have the team members write out what
   successes, events, and strengths they can see for the future sprint. After 
   these have been posted and read, have the team sort both future and present
   notes into categories so that a pattern forms.
4. Next:
   Members can vote on what needs to be sustained through the next sprint.
   Open discussion of what needs to be done to sustain positive locomotion.


Why I think it is a good idea:
Positivity is often an overlooked aspect of retrospectives. Sometimes, all
that's needed to motivate people to work is to show them what good they are
doing. This being said, I think it also has a bandaid quality on the negative
issues plaguing the project.


Other methods that were interesting:
Tissue Massage Retrospective
http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Deep_Tissue_Massage_Retrospective
This one focuses on finding the really problematic spots and working them
until they can be released/worked out.
